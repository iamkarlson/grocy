## URL
The Grocy url should be in the form below (start with `http://` or `https://`) and point to your Grocy instance. If you use a SSL certificate you should have `https` and also check the "Verify SSL Certificate" box. Do **not** enter a port in the url field. Subdomains are also supported, fill out the full url in the field.

## API key
Go to your Grocy instance. Navigate via the wrench icon in the top right corner to "Manage API keys" and add a new API key. Copy and paste the generated key.

## Port
It should work with for example a Duck DNS address as well, but you still have to access it via a port, and the above instructions for the url still apply.
- If you have configured the [Grocy add-on](#addon) as described, use port 9192 (without https). Either be sure the port is open in your router or use your internal Home Assistant address.
- If you have configured an [external Grocy](#both) instance and not sure, use port 80 for http or port 443 for https. Unless you have set a custom port for Grocy.
